I am not actually taking the class, just working through the projects on my own and uploading them here. I'm having some people look over them. If you're some poor lost soul taking the class, I strongly recommend against using my work for reference since I'm not doing this for a grade and am just trying to get better at python. The condition to my trying to get better is that I'm not very good right now.

So yeah, go do your homework.
